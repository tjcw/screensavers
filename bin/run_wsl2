# This assumes you have VcXsrv configured. You can get this from
# https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
# do not forget to allow VcXsrv in the Windows firewall settings: Windows Security -> Firewall & network protection -> Allow an app through firewall -> make sure VcXsrv has both public and private checked.
# Also it is necessary to follow the instructions here
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config
# i.e. put the lines
#
# [wsl2]
# guiApplications=false
#
# into file .wslconfig in your Windows home directory. This works for both
# windows10 and windows11
# Affer changing this file you need to 
# wsl --shutdown
# and wait 8 seconds before restarting debian, in order to get wsl2 to pick up
# the values from .wslconfig
